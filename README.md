## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Pedro H. Chaves Maia and I work as a researcher at the [Institute for Mobility and Social Development](https://imdsbrasil.org/en/home-en/) and as an adjunct professor at the [EPGE Brazilian School of Economics and Finance](https://epge.fgv.br/en) in Brazil

## Research Interests ðŸ”­
My research agenda focuses on spatial economics. In specific, I work on the implications of urban accessibility and resilience for economic growth and the welfare of city residents. I leverage big data and GIS applications to assess spatially disaggregated infrastructure effects. 
* Urban and Regional Economics
* Transport Economics
* Development Economics
* Environmental Economics

## Packages and Models ðŸ“¦
I mostly work using Python and Julia. It follows an overview of the packages and models I have either made or reproduced and that may prove useful to others!
